Scala implementation of [Symbolic Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation) for matrices. 
This can assist academics in performing the tedious manipulations on algebraic formulas that are now done mostly manually.

I found many similar libraries that work on scalars, but none on matrices, so that should make this library quite unique.

Documentation TBD, but the test specs should already give a good overview of what is possible.

Simplification of algebraic formulas will also be added soon.
